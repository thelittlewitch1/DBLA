# Data-Base_Lerning-Achievements
 University practice in c++. Creating of the simplest database for storage info about student's marks.

Purpouse of the practise was create a program in the C++ programming language that helps to monitor the progress of students.
Database must be created with information about the progress of students, consisting of the last name, first name and four grades for each student, in which you can:
 - Add, delete and edit information about students;
 - To load and unload data from a binary file;
 - Display all available information on the screen;
 - Sort information about students by last name (in alphabetical order) and by the average score.
 
All functions must be implemented strictly as class methods.
